            <h2>Sunday Meeting</h2>
            <p class="lead">We understand that the truest sense of worship is what we offer to God every day of our lives, not just on Sunday.</p>

            <p>But the worship that we give to God in the weekly meeting on Sunday is vitally important to the life of the church, and the best kind of Sunday worship helps to shape the rest of our week. This is why we desire to think carefully about how we come before God in the weekly meeting.</p>

            <h2>Statement of Faith</h2>
            <ol class="important">

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that the Holy Scriptures as found in the original manuscripts,</a><br /><div class="toggleview">are the inspired and infallible revelation of God to man. The Holy Scriptures consist of the sixty-six books of the Old and the New Testaments, which were written by holy men and prophets of old as they were led by the Holy Spirit. In them, God reveals His covenant, wherein instructions for all man's worship and living are either expressly written or reasonably inferred. We believe that only by the Holy Spirit's regeneration can man come to a saving knowledge of God through Scripture, and only by the Spirit's illumination can he fully understand its truths. We also believe that in all controversies, the Scriptures must be our final judge, so that God alone rules His church and His people through His Word.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that there is one God who created the heavens and the earth,</a><br /><div class="toggleview">who exists in three eternally united yet distinct persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that the Son is eternally begotten of the Father,</a><br /><div class="toggleview">and that for us and our salvation He became man, being conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and was born of the virgin Mary. He lived a life of suffering, and was crucified and buried, and on the third day He was from the dead. He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father and will return again to judge both the living and the dead.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that Christ's kingdom was inaugurated through His ministry,</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> and He now rules with all authority in heaven and will bring His kingdom to consummation with His second coming. The Good News or the Gospel is the proclamation of Christ's Lordship and all that Christ's Lordship entails, not least is the receiving of God's sole provision of reconciliation through the death of Jesus Christ for our sins.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that Christ's death on the cross was substitutionary.</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> This means that our sins are imputed to Christ and atoned for on the cross. We further believe that Christ's death was both propitiatory and expiatory. By propitiatory, we mean that Jesus' death appeases the Father's wrath against our sin and rebellion. By expiatory we mean that the guilt of our sin is removed by Christ's sacrificial death. We also believe that apart from the reception of pardon through Christ's atoning death, that there is no reconciliation to God.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that we gain the benefits of Christ's sacrificial death by a persevering faith in all that God has graciously promised,</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> and by persevering faithfulness to all that God has graciously commanded us through Jesus Christ and His inspired apostles in the New Covenant. We believe that faith in all God has promised through Christ is the means by which we obey all that God has commanded through Christ. We further believe that both faith in the promises of God and obedience to the commands of God are enabled by the grace of God, as man is unable to respond of his own accord to the "good news" of God's saving provision.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that Jesus Christ will return to judge the living and the dead.</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> By this we mean that Jesus will return to vindicate and reward with eternal life all those who have overcome and remained faithful to Him through His gracious covenant and to condemn all those who have rejected Him and failed to overcome, stand firm, and remain faithful to Him through His gracious covenant.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that all those who are rewarded with eternal life will populate the New Heavens and the New Earth</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> and will enjoy the blessed presence of God and His renewed creation forever. This renewed creation will be a full restoration of the pre-fall paradise existence at that time being universally and eternally enjoyed. We also believe that those who are condemned will forever be cast out of God's blessed presence and thereby suffer an eternal state of conscious torment in hell.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that the Church is the gathering of believers,</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> who come together for instruction and exhortation from the Word of God, for the observation of the church's ordinances of baptism and the Lord's Supper, for worship and fellowship, mutual encouragement and correction, and equipping for service and mission. We believe that the Church was instituted by Jesus Christ as a necessary means of grace by which His people persevere in faith and faithfulness. As His people persevere in faith and faithfulness we are a light to the nations and bear testimony by word and deed to the supremacy of Christ in all things.</div></li>

            <p class="lead">By Mark Skillin</p>
            <p>Evangelical Christianity has long been founded on the theological tradition of "justification by faith alone." This is the heart of the Protestant gospel. But how close is it to the Gospel revealed in Scripture? In Saved by Faithfulness, Rev. Mark Skillin highlights the interpretational problems that emerge when one holds to a faith alone paradigm. He talks about the importance of the concept of covenant in Scripture, and demonstrates through a survey of the biblical covenants that God has always placed faith and obedience in very close relationship to each other as necessary for the salvation of His people. Saved by Faithfulness challenges centuries of Scriptural interpretation and consequent church practice which have enshrined a distorted gospel, with far reaching consequences for the church. It is a call to return to faithful biblical interpretation and faithful Christian lives.</p>

            <p class="lead">By Mark Skillin</p>
            <p>It may be wondered why another book on the cross of Christ is necessary. Simply put, most writings have limited themselves to the meaning of the cross in terms of the cleansing our sin, apart from covenantal considerations. When the cross is understood in terms of the covenant, in turns out that Christ's cross-work has far more expansive meaning for us than we have traditionally thought. Saved by the Cross seeks to explore this expansive meaning.</p>

            <h4>Mark Skillin</h4>
            <p>"For all of Luther’s protest against philosophical reasoning distorting the Word of God, it is clear that he himself failed to exegete Scripture on its own terms and by its own assumptions. Unbiblical dualism has been a longtime opponent of the biblical worldview. Clearly, Luther’s assumptions have caused him to misrepresent the apostle Paul at important points having to do with obedience to commands and faith in God."</p>

            <h4>Chris Yokel</h4>
            <p>"We often focus on the beginning and end of Jesus' life. His birth was important because it ushered in the mystery of the Incarnation, and it heralded the coming of salvation. His suffering, death, and resurrection form the central pillars of that salvation, so we rightly focus on them as well. But what about all the in-between stuff? What about the Sermon on the Mount, the parables, the healings, all of that? Here is where Christians fall into different camps."</p>

            <h4>Mark Skillin</h4>
            <p>"But after coming to this conclusion [that works enabled by faith justify us before God], it occurred to me that it would be very interesting to look again, and in some cases for the first time, at the teachings of the earliest church fathers. What I discovered was a pleasant surprise. As it turns out, the earliest apologists and pastors had a remarkably Pauline understanding of salvation. The burden of this article is to show how this is the case. The conception of how and when the early fathers understood they were to be justified before God bears a remarkable and unmistakable similarity to Paul's doctrine. What will be seen is that these modern scholars, whom I have quoted, are in fact correct. Justification by faith alone is absent in the vast majority of early patristic teaching."</p>

            <h4>Chris Yokel</h4>
            <p>"But then we have the objection come up again: 'But everything we do is tainted with sin.' This argument is often given this way: 'All our works are like filthy rags before God.'  This sentiment and this phrase 'filthy rags' is drawn from Isaiah 64.  There’s just one rather glaring problem—it’s taken out of context.  In fact, in this passage Isaiah clearly says that there are some righteous works that God’s people can and should do that God is pleased with."</p>

            <h4>Chris Yokel</h4>
            <p>"Throughout the Bible, covenant is the medium through which God always relates to His people. God has never related to mankind or to His people apart from or outside of a covenant relationship. Covenant then is the atmosphere that we breathe as Christians, and it is the atmosphere that permeates all of Scripture. It is of vital importance then that we properly understand the shape of covenants throughout Scripture, and where that leaves us standing today as people in covenant with the holy God. It is also important how we see the covenants relating to one another, for as we will see, the conclusions that we draw about one often lead to our understanding of the others."</p>

            <p>"The great fear in evangelicalism since Luther is that we 'add to the gospel.' This, of course, we must never do.
