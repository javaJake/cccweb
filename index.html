            <p class="lead">We understand that the truest sense of worship is what we offer to God every day of our lives, not just on Sunday.</p>

            <p>But the worship that we give to God in the weekly meeting on Sunday is vitally important to the life of the church, and the best kind of Sunday worship helps to shape the rest of our week. This is why we desire to think carefully about how we come before God in the weekly meeting.</p>

            <h2>Statement of Faith</h2>
            <ol class="important">

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that the Holy Scriptures as found in the original manuscripts,</a><br /><div class="toggleview">are the inspired and infallible revelation of God to man. The Holy Scriptures consist of the sixty-six books of the Old and the New Testaments, which were written by holy men and prophets of old as they were led by the Holy Spirit. In them, God reveals His covenant, wherein instructions for all man's worship and living are either expressly written or reasonably inferred. We believe that only by the Holy Spirit's regeneration can man come to a saving knowledge of God through Scripture, and only by the Spirit's illumination can he fully understand its truths. We also believe that in all controversies, the Scriptures must be our final judge, so that God alone rules His church and His people through His Word.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that there is one God who created the heavens and the earth,</a><br /><div class="toggleview">who exists in three eternally united yet distinct persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that the Son is eternally begotten of the Father,</a><br /><div class="toggleview">and that for us and our salvation He became man, being conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and was born of the virgin Mary. He lived a life of suffering, and was crucified and buried, and on the third day He was from the dead. He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father and will return again to judge both the living and the dead.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that Christ's kingdom was inaugurated through His ministry,</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> and He now rules with all authority in heaven and will bring His kingdom to consummation with His second coming. The Good News or the Gospel is the proclamation of Christ's Lordship and all that Christ's Lordship entails, not least is the receiving of God's sole provision of reconciliation through the death of Jesus Christ for our sins.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that Christ's death on the cross was substitutionary.</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> This means that our sins are imputed to Christ and atoned for on the cross. We further believe that Christ's death was both propitiatory and expiatory. By propitiatory, we mean that Jesus' death appeases the Father's wrath against our sin and rebellion. By expiatory we mean that the guilt of our sin is removed by Christ's sacrificial death. We also believe that apart from the reception of pardon through Christ's atoning death, that there is no reconciliation to God.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that we gain the benefits of Christ's sacrificial death by a persevering faith in all that God has graciously promised,</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> and by persevering faithfulness to all that God has graciously commanded us through Jesus Christ and His inspired apostles in the New Covenant. We believe that faith in all God has promised through Christ is the means by which we obey all that God has commanded through Christ. We further believe that both faith in the promises of God and obedience to the commands of God are enabled by the grace of God, as man is unable to respond of his own accord to the "good news" of God's saving provision.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that Jesus Christ will return to judge the living and the dead.</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> By this we mean that Jesus will return to vindicate and reward with eternal life all those who have overcome and remained faithful to Him through His gracious covenant and to condemn all those who have rejected Him and failed to overcome, stand firm, and remain faithful to Him through His gracious covenant.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that all those who are rewarded with eternal life will populate the New Heavens and the New Earth</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> and will enjoy the blessed presence of God and His renewed creation forever. This renewed creation will be a full restoration of the pre-fall paradise existence at that time being universally and eternally enjoyed. We also believe that those who are condemned will forever be cast out of God's blessed presence and thereby suffer an eternal state of conscious torment in hell.</div></li>

<li><a class="toggleclick">We believe that the Church is the gathering of believers,</a><br /><div class="toggleview"> who come together for instruction and exhortation from the Word of God, for the observation of the church's ordinances of baptism and the Lord's Supper, for worship and fellowship, mutual encouragement and correction, and equipping for service and mission. We believe that the Church was instituted by Jesus Christ as a necessary means of grace by which His people persevere in faith and faithfulness. As His people persevere in faith and faithfulness we are a light to the nations and bear testimony by word and deed to the supremacy of Christ in all things.</div></li>

            <p class="lead">By Mark Skillin</p>
            <p>Evangelical Christianity has long been founded on the theological tradition of "justification by faith alone." This is the heart of the Protestant gospel. But how close is it to the Gospel revealed in Scripture? In Saved by Faithfulness, Rev. Mark Skillin highlights the interpretational problems that emerge when one holds to a faith alone paradigm. He talks about the importance of the concept of covenant in Scripture, and demonstrates through a survey of the biblical covenants that God has always placed faith and obedience in very close relationship to each other as necessary for the salvation of His people. Saved by Faithfulness challenges centuries of Scriptural interpretation and consequent church practice which have enshrined a distorted gospel, with far reaching consequences for the church. It is a call to return to faithful biblical interpretation and faithful Christian lives.</p>

            <p class="lead">By Mark Skillin</p>
            <p>It may be wondered why another book on the cross of Christ is necessary. Simply put, most writings have limited themselves to the meaning of the cross in terms of the cleansing our sin, apart from covenantal considerations. When the cross is understood in terms of the covenant, in turns out that Christ's cross-work has far more expansive meaning for us than we have traditionally thought. Saved by the Cross seeks to explore this expansive meaning.</p>

But what struck me this morning was the culmination of Paul’s prayer for the saints in Ephesus, that they “may know him better” (1:17).
