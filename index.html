          <h2>Sunday Meeting</h2>
          <p class="raised">We understand that the truest sense of worship is what we offer to God every day of our lives, not just on Sunday.</p>

          <p>But the worship that we give to God in the weekly meeting on Sunday is vitally important to the life of the church, and the best kind of Sunday worship helps to shape the rest of our week. This is why we desire to think carefully about how we come before God in the weekly meeting.</p>

          <p><i>Every Sunday at 10:30p.</i></p>
